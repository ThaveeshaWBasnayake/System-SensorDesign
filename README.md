# System-SensorDesign
System and Sensor Design 2023

This GitHub repository contains all the material covered from Week 2 to Week 7 of the System and Sensor Design classes for 2023. 

Each folder will contain the work completed both in the online laboratory and offline laboratory sessions, with commenting so that the user can understand each section of code.

The content covered in these weeks include the basic functions of MATLAB to complicated actions such as creating functions, drawing discrete and continuous signals as well 
as calling upon these in the command window. 
Each week the difficulty of the MATLAB exercises has increased, but these have been completed to the best of one's ability and uploaded. Furthermore, the completed homeworks for the respective weeks have also been uploaded to the corresponding weeks. A description of what was included in each week is avaliable in the GUI interface.
